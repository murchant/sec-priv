#### Risk Identification

For each component of the system, as many risks as possible would need to be identified.

#### Risk Classification

Once as many risks as possible have been identified, the risks would have to be classified in terms of:
  * The impact they would have on the company
  * The likelihood of them occurring

The risks' impact and likelihood would be given values to from low to high
to normalise the importance of mitigating each risk. These values would be used
to order the risks by their importance.

#### Risk Mitigation

After the risks have been ordered by importance, a mitigation is designed for
the most important risk on the list.

#### Iteration

As each risk is mitigated (or as necessary), the list is re-analysed to assess
the proper order for the remaining risks. This is because the mitigation for
one risk could effect the probability of other risks or may introduce new risks.

#### Termination

In practice, the process is terminated once available efforts are expended. Time and money may mean that mitigations may not be designed for every possible risk.

## Risks

Question is either about a company setting up:

      1. A new website
      2. Replace existing website
      2. New System for staff (eg: mail)
      3. Replace Existing system (eg:mail)

| Website | Mail | System|
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Leak of Customer DB | Phishing| Data leakage via stolen/lost laptop |
|  Availability eg: DDos| MUAs render active  content  | Data leakage via the 3d party|
| Outsourcers/3rd parties need equal security| Availability (lack thereof) services| Denial-of-Service attacks on the 3rd party|
| Staff working with competitors| servers badly configured (e.g. spf, dkim, dmarc)| Cloud-providers monitoring site traffic/data for own/competitors/governments benefit |
|  Staff from other out-sourced providers| Badly configured MUAs e.g.MUAs that redirect to gmail| Third Party abuse (malware, scanners)|
| | Mail snooping via MX stealing or BGP | |


#### Key Rules

1. Anything where a third party is invloved, a risk is Ddos, hack, staff, data leakage of third party.
2. Cloud providers have ability to monitor traffic if used.
3. Ddos more or less a threat for everything apart from mail.
4. He rambled a lot about Trojan horses, MUA w/ active content, and phishing in lectures.


# Mail

**Mail Terminology:**
    1. MTA (Mail Transfer Agent)—a “mail server”
    2. MUA (Mail User Agent)—what a user uses to send/receive mail
    3. Message Envelope—addressing information sent with a message
    4. Transparent forwarder—an MTA that resends a message without modification


## 1.  Phishing/Spam/Malware

- Spam: Unsolicited Bulk/Commercial Email.
- Bad Because:
    1. Resource consumption (Filters, scanners cost time & money).
    2. Phishing attempts which lead sensitive leakage.
    3. Malware can run through MUA js active content
- Hard to know whats spam, eg Hilary Election.
- Spam Tricks:
    1. Email to list, send via open relay.
    2. Confusion similar email addresses.
    3. Trojans, Zombie host
- Spam Stats
    1. 70% ISP backbone email traffic



#### How to Solve:
    1. Content filtering (eg: Bayesian)
    2. DNS blacklisting (SORBS, DNSBL)
    3. SPF, DKIM, DMARC
    4. CSV


### Bayesian Filter
- Other approaches use email headers.
- B Filter uses Bayesian identifier to get whole context of email.
- probability some words infer spam.

### DNSBL
- Domain Name System Blacklists are spam blocking lists.
- Allow a website administrator to block messages from specific systems that have a history of sending spam.
- Lists are based on the Internet's Domain Name System.

Pros: Easy to implement.
Cons: Easy to bypass.

### SPF, DKIM, DMARC
**SPF (Sender Policy Framework):**
Path based techniques. DNS text entry which shows a list of servers that should be considered allowed to send mail for a specific domain.

Check origin address and cross reference with DNS .txt record.

**DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail):**
Signature based technique. Header based signature intended to protect sender from spoofing. Method to verify that the messages’ content are trustworthy, ie: they weren’t changed from the moment the message left the initial mail server. achieved by an implementation of the standard public/private key signing process. Signing and verification usually done by MUA, MTA.

**DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance):**
Empowers SPF and DKIM by stating a clear policy which should be used about both the aforementioned tools.

SPF determines path authorisation. DKIM confirms association of content with domain name.

Both have obvious failure modes, which don't overlap much. The union of their pass modes appears to be quite sufficient for DMARCS goals.

- Policy	is	retrieved	from	the	DNS	of	the	domain found	in	the	"From" field.

# 2. MUAs render active content
- Modern web browser use scripting languages like javascript for active content.
- Malicious active content can be sent, run malicious code without consent by browser.
- Collect sensitive information, give away location, email check example.
- 1x1 embedded image, marketing, can check if you've opened mail, how many times.
- **Solution:** Disable active content rendering.


# 3.  Badly configured MUAs
- redirect to a mua which does stuff you've configured your MUA not to do.

# 4. Availability
- Can make system secure, ie: can't log in without being on the network. That way phishing doesn't matter, cause you cannae log in.
- Your staff could use VPN.
- This would effect ease-of-access for your employees though.
- Lock it down/ want it to be available

# 5. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack
- Attackers make service impossible to be delivered.
- Attacker sends series of malicious requests which overrun target CPUs/RAM resources.
- Server crashes under demand.
- High risk and high effect, can't afford to have service down and easy to implement attack.

**Mitigation:**
1. Observe normal traffic patterns, which makes it easier to distinguish normal and suspicious traffic.
2. Predict bot or Human.
   Done by:
   Detection:
    - Checking req IP address
    - Checking req freq
   Filtering:
    - Blacklisting
    - IP reputation lists
    - rate limiting
    - Traffic scrubbing filters, high capacity traffic filtering capabilities.

# Website

# 1. DDoS
- Explain
- High probability
- High risk

# 2. Leak of Customer DB
- High Risk
- Medium probability

#### SQL Injection
SQL injection attack involved user exposing vulnerabilities of front end web applications by unauthorised database queries.

Attacker can used these to gain access to sensitive user information, or delete all "DROP" databases.

eg: SQL Slammer worm took advantage of a Microsoft SQL Server protocol vulnerability to execute attack code on target database servers.

**Mitigation**
- Use firewall to help filter out malicious data.
- Don't use dynamic SQL, don't construct queries with user input.

#### Cross site scripting


# 3. Outsource to 3rd party

#### Excessive privileges to 3rd party users
- Granting 3rd party or staff Excessive privileges for their role.
- Abuse the Infrastructure from within if they're talking to competitors.

# 4. Staff working with competitors
- Privilege abuse of staff working with competitors
- Unauthorised privilege elevation by inside staff or attackers.

# 5. Cloud Providers monitoring traffic
- Cloud-providers monitoring site traffic and data for their own benefit or for the benefit of competitors or governments.
- Finance companies looking at specific investment targets etc etc.

# 6. Pervasive monitoring
- Hackers eavesdrop and monitor on all your network connections.
- Try and extract meaning from meta data.

# 7. General Data leakage
- Laptop lost/stolen
